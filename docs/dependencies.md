# Dependencies

  * LinuxCNC master (2.8~pre)
  * Gtk+ v3.22.11 or later
  * Python 2.7

Hazzy is developed and tested using the LinuxCNC Debian 9 (stretch) Live ISO,
available [here](http://www.linuxcnc.org/testing-stretch-rtpreempt/).
It is highly recommended that you use that OS, since it is officially supported
and will require minimal effort to get hazzy running. However, hazzy _should_ run
fine on any recent Linux distro that ships with GTK+ 3.22.11 or later. Users
have not been able to successfully run hazzy on older OSs like Mint 18.3 do to
difficulty installing the required version of GTK+ 3.
